# Glycogen Usage Garmin Connect IQ App

This application allows users to input substrate (CHO) usage data and a corresponding wattage to more accurately calculate fuel use while riding a bike equipped with a power meter

## How to use

I'm assuming you have already downloaded the app and are being prompted, either on Garmin Express or on the Garmin Connect Mobile App, to enter various Carbohydrate burn and Wattage data.

Generally you will have received a chart or graph from a metabolic cart test (measures your gas expiration during a lactate test) that corresponds to a certain wattage. For each of those data points enter the 1st value in 'grams per min' or 'g/min' and the wattage value that happened at that effort. Continue on down till all values you have are filled in. If you do not have 7 data points to input take your highest CHO and WATT values and enter them into the remaining spaces. If you have more than 7 data points please contact me at: mark@outdoorplaylist.com.  Any and all feedback and comments are welcome.
